# vault-write Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change vault-write-completion. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Atomic write invariant

The system SHALL perform all file writes from MCP write tools via a temporary file in the same directory as the destination followed by `os.replace()` (or equivalent atomic rename on the same filesystem). The applicable tools are `create_note`, `edit_note`, `move_note`, `delete_note`, and `set_frontmatter`. Direct writes that could leave the destination truncated on crash SHALL NOT be used.

#### Scenario: Crash mid-write does not truncate the destination

- **WHEN** the server process is killed between the tmp-file write and the
  rename
- **THEN** the destination file SHALL retain its prior content unchanged
- **AND** the orphaned `.tmp-*` file SHALL be discoverable for cleanup by
  the next reindex (it lives in a dot-prefixed name, so the indexer
  ignores it)

#### Scenario: Successful write atomically replaces existing content

- **WHEN** `edit_note` is called with new content and succeeds
- **THEN** any reader observing the destination path SHALL see either the
  full prior content or the full new content, never a partial mix

### Requirement: Write tools require a `readwrite` API key

Each write tool SHALL call the existing `_require_write()` helper before performing any filesystem mutation. The applicable tools are `create_note`, `edit_note`, `move_note`, `delete_note`, and `set_frontmatter`. Calls authenticated with a read-only key SHALL receive the existing "Permission denied" error message and SHALL NOT mutate the vault.

#### Scenario: Read-only key cannot move a note

- **WHEN** a client authenticated with a read-only key invokes
  `move_note(from_path=..., to_path=...)`
- **THEN** the server SHALL return the standard permission-denied message
- **AND** SHALL NOT move the file or update the database

#### Scenario: Read-only key cannot soft-delete

- **WHEN** a client authenticated with a read-only key invokes
  `delete_note(path=...)`
- **THEN** the server SHALL return the permission-denied message
- **AND** the note SHALL remain at its original path

### Requirement: `edit_note` supports four mutually exclusive modes

The `edit_note` tool SHALL expose exactly four edit modes, selected by the
combination of parameters supplied: full-replace (default), append,
find/replace, and section. The four modes SHALL be mutually exclusive —
supplying parameters that select more than one mode SHALL return an
actionable error and SHALL NOT mutate the file.

#### Scenario: Full-replace mode (default)

- **WHEN** the client calls `edit_note(path, content)` with neither
  `append`, `find`, nor `section` set
- **THEN** the entire note SHALL be overwritten with `content`

#### Scenario: Append mode

- **WHEN** the client calls `edit_note(path, content, append=True)`
  without `find` or `section`
- **THEN** the new file content SHALL be the prior content followed by a
  single `\n` separator and `content`

#### Scenario: Find/replace mode

- **WHEN** the client calls `edit_note(path, content, find=<text>)`
  without `append=True` or `section`
- **THEN** the system SHALL replace occurrences of `find` in the prior
  content with `content` per the `replace_all` rules below

#### Scenario: Section mode

- **WHEN** the client calls `edit_note(path, content, section=<heading>)`
  without `append=True` or `find`
- **THEN** the system SHALL replace the body under the named ATX heading
  per the section-mode rules below

#### Scenario: Multiple modes set is rejected

- **WHEN** the client supplies more than one of `append=True`,
  `find=...`, or `section=...` in the same call
- **THEN** the system SHALL return an error naming the conflicting
  parameters
- **AND** SHALL NOT modify the file

### Requirement: Find/replace mode supports single-match and replace-all

When `find` is supplied, `edit_note` SHALL by default require `find` to
appear exactly once in the prior content (preserving the existing
behavior). When `replace_all=True` is also supplied, the tool SHALL
replace every occurrence of `find` with `content`. Setting `replace_all`
without `find` SHALL be ignored (no error).

#### Scenario: Single match (default)

- **WHEN** `find` matches exactly one location and `replace_all` is not
  set or is False
- **THEN** that single occurrence SHALL be replaced with `content`

#### Scenario: Zero matches returns actionable error

- **WHEN** `find` does not appear in the prior content
- **THEN** the response SHALL state that the find text was not found and
  SHALL include a preview of the first 500 characters of the note
- **AND** SHALL NOT modify the file

#### Scenario: Multiple matches without replace_all returns actionable error

- **WHEN** `find` matches more than once and `replace_all` is False or
  unset
- **THEN** the response SHALL state the match count and instruct the
  caller to add surrounding context or set `replace_all=True`
- **AND** SHALL NOT modify the file

#### Scenario: Multiple matches with replace_all replaces all

- **WHEN** `find` matches N>=1 times and `replace_all=True`
- **THEN** all N occurrences SHALL be replaced with `content`
- **AND** the response SHALL report the number of replacements made

### Requirement: Section mode replaces the body under a named heading

When `section=<heading>` is supplied, `edit_note` SHALL locate the first
ATX heading (1–6 `#` characters) whose trimmed text equals `<heading>`
and SHALL replace the lines between that heading and the next heading of
equal-or-shallower depth (or end of file) with the supplied `content`.
The matched heading line itself SHALL NOT be removed or rewritten.

#### Scenario: Replace section under a level-2 heading

- **WHEN** the note contains `## Tasks\nA\nB\n## Notes\nC` and the client
  calls `edit_note(path, content="X\nY", section="Tasks")`
- **THEN** the resulting note SHALL be `## Tasks\nX\nY\n## Notes\nC`

#### Scenario: Section heading not found

- **WHEN** no ATX heading in the note has trimmed text equal to
  `<heading>`
- **THEN** the response SHALL list the headings that ARE present in the
  note (with their depth) and instruct the caller to disambiguate
- **AND** SHALL NOT modify the file

#### Scenario: Multiple matching headings disambiguated by occurrence

- **WHEN** more than one heading in the note matches `<heading>` exactly
- **THEN** the response SHALL state the number of matches and instruct
  the caller to use the more-specific path-style form
  `Parent Heading/Child Heading` to disambiguate
- **AND** SHALL NOT modify the file until the call is reissued
  unambiguously

#### Scenario: Path-style heading disambiguation

- **WHEN** the client calls `edit_note(path, content, section="Tasks/Today")`
  and the note contains `## Tasks` followed by `### Today`
- **THEN** the system SHALL replace the body under `### Today` (bounded
  by the next heading of depth ≤ 3) with `content`

### Requirement: `dry_run` returns a unified diff without mutating

`edit_note` SHALL accept a `dry_run: bool = False` parameter applicable
to all four edit modes. When `dry_run=True`, the tool SHALL compute the
would-be new content, return a unified diff (via `difflib.unified_diff`)
between the prior content and the would-be new content, and SHALL NOT
write to the filesystem.

#### Scenario: Dry-run returns the diff text

- **WHEN** the client calls `edit_note(path, content, find=<text>, dry_run=True)`
- **THEN** the response SHALL be a string containing a unified diff with
  `---` / `+++` headers and `@@` hunk markers
- **AND** the file at `path` SHALL be byte-identical before and after
  the call

#### Scenario: Dry-run on a no-op edit

- **WHEN** the requested edit would produce the same content as exists
  on disk
- **THEN** the response SHALL indicate no changes (empty diff or "no
  changes")
- **AND** SHALL NOT write to the filesystem

### Requirement: `move_note` renames or relocates a note and updates the link graph

The MCP server SHALL expose a tool `move_note(from_path: str, to_path:
str, rewrite_links: bool = False) -> str` that moves the note at
`from_path` to `to_path`, updates `notes_metadata.file_path` for the
moved note, and updates `note_links.target_path` for every row whose
prior `target_path` was `from_path`. Rename and move SHALL be the same
operation (a rename is a move whose `to_path` differs only in basename).

#### Scenario: Move within the vault

- **WHEN** the client calls `move_note(from_path="Cards/A.md",
  to_path="Cards/B.md")` and `Cards/A.md` exists and `Cards/B.md` does
  not
- **THEN** the file SHALL be moved on disk via atomic rename
- **AND** `notes_metadata.file_path` for that note SHALL be updated to
  `Cards/B.md`
- **AND** every `note_links` row whose `target_path` was `Cards/A.md`
  SHALL have `target_path` updated to `Cards/B.md`
- **AND** outgoing-link rows authored by the moved note SHALL continue to
  resolve from it without further DB mutation (the moved note's primary
  key is unchanged, so `note_links.source_note_id` foreign keys remain
  valid)

#### Scenario: Move creates missing destination directory

- **WHEN** `to_path` is `New/Folder/X.md` and `New/Folder/` does not
  exist
- **THEN** the system SHALL create the parent directories before moving
  the file

#### Scenario: Destination exists

- **WHEN** the file at `to_path` already exists
- **THEN** the response SHALL state that the destination exists and
  refuse the move
- **AND** the file at `from_path` SHALL remain in place
- **AND** the link graph SHALL NOT be modified

#### Scenario: Source missing

- **WHEN** the file at `from_path` does not exist
- **THEN** the response SHALL state that the source is missing
- **AND** SHALL NOT modify the link graph

#### Scenario: Path traversal rejected

- **WHEN** either `from_path` or `to_path` resolves outside the vault
  root via the existing `validate_path` helper
- **THEN** the response SHALL return the standard validation error
- **AND** SHALL NOT touch the filesystem or database

### Requirement: `move_note` rewrites incoming wikilinks only when opted in

When `rewrite_links=True`, `move_note` SHALL additionally rewrite
incoming `[[wikilinks]]` and `![[embeds]]` in source notes to point at
the new title/path. The set of source notes SHALL be the same set
returned by `get_backlinks(from_path)` prior to the move. When
`rewrite_links=False` (default), source-note bodies SHALL NOT be
modified.

#### Scenario: Default leaves source-note bodies untouched

- **WHEN** the client calls `move_note(from_path, to_path)` without
  setting `rewrite_links`
- **THEN** no source-note files SHALL be opened or rewritten
- **AND** any `[[OldTitle]]` references in the vault SHALL remain as
  written and become dangling references

#### Scenario: Opt-in rewrite updates incoming wikilinks

- **WHEN** the client calls `move_note(from_path="Cards/Foo.md",
  to_path="Cards/Bar.md", rewrite_links=True)` and a source note
  contains `[[Foo]]` or `![[Foo]]`
- **THEN** the source note SHALL be updated so that `[[Foo]]` becomes
  `[[Bar]]` and `![[Foo]]` becomes `![[Bar]]`
- **AND** any block/heading suffix following `Foo` (e.g. `[[Foo#H1]]`,
  `[[Foo#^abc]]`) SHALL be preserved and only the title portion
  SHALL be rewritten

#### Scenario: Aliased wikilinks have alias preserved

- **WHEN** a source note contains `[[Foo|Display Text]]` and
  `rewrite_links=True`
- **THEN** the link SHALL be rewritten to `[[Bar|Display Text]]`

#### Scenario: Path-style wikilinks updated when used

- **WHEN** a source note contains `[[folder/Foo]]` referencing the moved
  note and `rewrite_links=True`
- **THEN** the link SHALL be rewritten to use the new path

### Requirement: `delete_note` soft-deletes to `.trash/` by default

The MCP server SHALL expose a tool `delete_note(path: str, permanent:
bool = False) -> str`. With `permanent=False` (default), the tool SHALL
move the note to `.trash/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<original-basename>` inside
the vault root, creating `.trash/` if needed. With `permanent=True`, the
tool SHALL `os.unlink()` the file directly. In both cases the response
SHALL identify what happened and where the file went (or that it was
permanently deleted).

#### Scenario: Soft-delete moves the file under `.trash/`

- **WHEN** the client calls `delete_note(path="Cards/Old.md")`
- **THEN** the file SHALL be moved to a path of the form
  `.trash/<timestamp>-Old.md` inside the vault root
- **AND** the response SHALL include the trash path

#### Scenario: Soft-delete is invisible to search

- **WHEN** a soft-deleted note has been moved into `.trash/` and the
  next reindex pass completes
- **THEN** the row in `notes_metadata` for that note SHALL be removed
- **AND** the dependent `note_embeddings` and `note_links` rows SHALL be
  cleaned up via existing FK cascades

#### Scenario: Permanent delete removes the file outright

- **WHEN** the client calls `delete_note(path="Cards/Old.md", permanent=True)`
- **THEN** the file SHALL be removed via `os.unlink()`
- **AND** the response SHALL state that the file was permanently deleted

#### Scenario: Trash collisions are disambiguated by timestamp

- **WHEN** the same note path is soft-deleted twice (e.g. user restores,
  then re-deletes)
- **THEN** each delete SHALL produce a distinct `.trash/` entry
  distinguished by its timestamp prefix

#### Scenario: Missing note returns an actionable error

- **WHEN** the client calls `delete_note` on a non-existent path
- **THEN** the response SHALL state that the note does not exist
- **AND** SHALL NOT create a `.trash/` directory

### Requirement: `set_frontmatter` performs structured frontmatter mutations

The MCP server SHALL expose a tool `set_frontmatter(path: str, updates:
dict, remove: list[str] = []) -> str` that parses the note's YAML
frontmatter, merges in `updates` (overwriting matching keys, adding new
ones), removes the keys listed in `remove`, and re-serializes the
frontmatter using `yaml.safe_dump(default_flow_style=False,
sort_keys=False, allow_unicode=True)`. The note body SHALL NOT be
modified.

#### Scenario: Update existing keys

- **WHEN** the client calls `set_frontmatter(path, updates={"status":
  "done"})` on a note whose frontmatter already has `status: draft`
- **THEN** the frontmatter SHALL contain `status: done` and all other
  keys SHALL be preserved with their existing values
- **AND** the body of the note SHALL be byte-identical to before the call

#### Scenario: Add a new key

- **WHEN** the client calls `set_frontmatter(path, updates={"project":
  "Cyberdeen"})` on a note whose frontmatter does not have a `project`
  key
- **THEN** the resulting frontmatter SHALL contain the existing keys
  plus `project: Cyberdeen`

#### Scenario: Remove keys

- **WHEN** the client calls `set_frontmatter(path, updates={},
  remove=["wip", "draft"])`
- **THEN** the resulting frontmatter SHALL not contain `wip` or `draft`
- **AND** any other existing keys SHALL be preserved

#### Scenario: Note has no existing frontmatter

- **WHEN** the note has no `---`-fenced frontmatter block at line 1 and
  the client calls `set_frontmatter(path, updates={"tags": ["x"]})`
- **THEN** a new frontmatter block SHALL be prepended to the note in the
  form `---\n<yaml>\n---\n` followed by the original body unchanged

#### Scenario: Note has frontmatter not on line 1

- **WHEN** the note begins with blank lines or other content before any
  `---` fence
- **THEN** the tool SHALL treat the note as having no frontmatter (per
  Obsidian's "frontmatter must be on line 1" rule) and SHALL prepend a
  new frontmatter block, leaving the original content unchanged after
  the new block

#### Scenario: Empty updates and empty removes is a no-op

- **WHEN** the client calls `set_frontmatter(path, updates={}, remove=[])`
- **THEN** the response SHALL indicate no changes
- **AND** the file SHALL be byte-identical before and after the call

### Requirement: Write-tool docstrings use neutral framing

Write-tool docstrings SHALL NOT instruct the agent to call `get_vault_guide` first using compelling language such as "MUST", "IMPORTANT: Call …first", or equivalent. The applicable tools are `create_note`, `edit_note`, `move_note`, `delete_note`, and `set_frontmatter`. References to `get_vault_guide` SHALL use neutral framing such as "see `get_vault_guide` for vault conventions". The docstrings SHALL NOT describe any tool as the "primary" or "default" write tool.

#### Scenario: Move/delete/set_frontmatter docstrings

- **WHEN** an MCP client lists tools
- **THEN** the docstrings of `move_note`, `delete_note`, and
  `set_frontmatter` SHALL each describe their use case and parameters
- **AND** SHALL NOT contain "MUST call" or "IMPORTANT: Call …first" in
  reference to `get_vault_guide`
- **AND** if any docstring mentions `get_vault_guide`, the reference
  SHALL be informational ("see", "for context", "describes")

### Requirement: Usage logs capture the new tools and parameters

Calls to `move_note`, `delete_note`, and `set_frontmatter` SHALL be
recorded via the existing `_tracked` decorator with `tool` set to the
respective tool name. Calls to `edit_note` that include `dry_run`,
`replace_all`, or `section` SHALL include those parameters in
`usage_logs.params` (subject to the existing string-truncation behavior
of `_tracked`).

#### Scenario: `move_note` invocation is logged

- **WHEN** an agent calls `move_note(from_path="A.md", to_path="B.md")`
- **THEN** a row SHALL be appended to `usage_logs` with
  `tool='move_note'` and `params` containing `from_path` and `to_path`

#### Scenario: `dry_run` flag is logged on `edit_note`

- **WHEN** an agent calls `edit_note(path, content, dry_run=True)`
- **THEN** the `usage_logs` row for that call SHALL have `tool='edit_note'`
- **AND** `params` SHALL include `dry_run`
