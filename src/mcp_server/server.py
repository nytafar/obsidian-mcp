    Four mutually exclusive modes (set at most one of append/find/section):

    2. **Append**: `append=True`; `content` is added at the end (preceded by a single newline).

    4. **Section**: `section=<heading>`; replaces the body under the named ATX heading.
       Use the path-style form `Parent/Child` to disambiguate when the same heading
       appears more than once. Setext (`====`/`----`) headings are not matched.

    Flags:
    - `replace_all=True`: with `find`, replace every occurrence rather than failing on
      multiple matches. Ignored when `find` is unset.
    - `dry_run=True`: compute the would-be result and return a unified diff without
