# Provenance

Vendored from [kepano/obsidian-skills](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-skills)
at commit `fa1e131a014576ff8f8919f191a7ca8d8fded39b`.

Only the `obsidian-markdown` skill is vendored here; it sources the
`get_vault_guide` primer in `src/mcp_server/vault_guide_primer.md`.
The other skills in upstream (`obsidian-bases`, `json-canvas`,
`obsidian-cli`, `defuddle`) were not vendored — pull them in if/when the
server grows to handle `.base` / `.canvas` files or shells out to the
Obsidian CLI.
