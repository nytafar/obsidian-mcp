# Obsidian MCP Server

Self-hosted MCP server exposing an Obsidian vault (~2,577 markdown files) via semantic search, full-text search, and agentic exploration.

## Stack
- Python 3.12 / FastAPI / uvicorn
- SQLAlchemy async + asyncpg + pgvector
- MCP Python SDK (Streamable HTTP)
- PostgreSQL 16 with pgvector (shared instance — see `.env`)
- Embedding provider abstraction (`src/services/embeddings.py`):
  - `OllamaProvider` — bge-m3 by default, set `OLLAMA_URL` in `.env`
  - `OpenAIProvider` — `text-embedding-3-{small,large}` over httpx, supports
    Azure OpenAI / OpenAI-compatible base URLs
- Jinja2 + htmx + Tailwind CDN control panel

## Project Layout
- `src/main.py` — FastAPI app, lifespan, MCP mount
- `src/config.py` — pydantic-settings
- `src/database.py` — async SQLAlchemy engine/session
- `src/models/db.py` — ORM models (api_keys, usage_logs, notes_metadata, note_embeddings, note_links)
- `src/mcp_server/` — MCP server, tools, auth middleware
- `src/services/` — vault ops, search, embeddings, indexer
- `src/api/` — control panel REST endpoints
- `src/control_panel/` — Jinja2 templates + static assets
- `alembic/` — database migrations

## Infrastructure
- Container: `obsidian-mcp`, listens on `:8000`
- Traefik routes: hostname driven by `MCP_HOSTNAME` in `.env`
  - Panel routes: OAuth protected via `chain-oauth@file`
  - MCP routes (`/mcp/*`): API key auth at app level
- Registry: `localhost:5000` (or change in `Makefile`)
- Deploy: `make deploy` (build → push → backup → recreate)

## Public repo — host paths live outside the tree
This repo is published on GitHub. Anything host-specific (paths, secrets,
hostnames) must stay out of tracked files. The mechanism:
- `Makefile.local` (gitignored) overrides `DEPLOY_DIR` and `DATA_DIR`. On
  the production host both point at `/storage/docker/data/obsidian-mcp/`,
  which holds the real `docker-compose.yml`, `.env`, and `backups/`.
- The compose project that owns the running container is rooted at
  `$(DEPLOY_DIR)`, not the repo. Always invoke `make` from the repo so
  `Makefile.local` loads — `cd /storage/docker/data/obsidian-mcp && docker
  compose ...` works but skips the build/push pipeline.
- The repo's `docker-compose.yml` and the deploy-dir copy are kept
  identical; if you change one, copy it over.

## Commands
- `make init` — first-time setup
- `make deploy` — full build and deploy
- `make db-init` — create database + pgvector extension
- `make db-migrate` — run alembic migrations
- `make logs` — tail container logs
- `make status` — check health

## Key Decisions
- API keys use `omcp_` prefix, stored as SHA-256 hashes
- Vault mounted read-write at /obsidian in container
- Embeddings: pluggable provider, `EmbeddingProvider` Protocol with two
  implementations (Ollama, OpenAI). Single `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` env var
  picks the backend; `get_provider()` is a cached singleton. Default is
  Ollama bge-m3 at 1024 dim, 512 token chunks, no overlap.
- Full-text search via PostgreSQL tsvector
- Vector search via pgvector HNSW index on `note_embeddings.embedding`
  (`vector_cosine_ops`, `m=16, ef_construction=64`); `semantic_search`
  sets `hnsw.ef_search=80` per query and dedupes per note in Python
  after a 5x overfetch
- Indexer runs on startup then every 5 minutes, hash-based change detection
- Wikilink graph extracted from note bodies into `note_links`; resolved at index time with same-folder-first preference
- `MCP_SANDBOX_MODE=true` is a registry-eval-only switch: lifespan skips `_check_embedding_dim` and the indexer, and `APIKeyMiddleware` bypasses auth on `/mcp/*`. Lets Glama's sandbox build the image and validate MCP introspection without external deps. Never enable in production — tools register but cannot run.

## Embedding providers
- `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=ollama` (default) — uses `OLLAMA_URL` and
  `EMBEDDING_MODEL`; serial single-input HTTP per chunk.
- `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai` — requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` (validated at
  startup). Uses `OPENAI_BASE_URL` (default `https://api.openai.com/v1`)
  and `OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL` (default `text-embedding-3-small`). Native
  batching: up to 96 inputs per `/v1/embeddings` POST, with sub-batching
  for larger lists. Retries 429/5xx with exponential backoff, max 3
  attempts.
- `EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS` (default 1024) controls both the pgvector column
  width and the `dimensions` param on OpenAI requests.
- Reset workflow: `make reset-embeddings` (or **Settings → Danger zone →
  Reset embeddings** in the panel) drops & recreates `note_embeddings.embedding`
  at the configured dim and clears every `embedded_content_hash`. The next
  indexer pass re-embeds the vault.
- Dimension-mismatch guard: lifespan startup queries `pg_attribute` for
  the live column dim and `sys.exit(1)`s if it disagrees with
  `EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS`, with a log message pointing to
  `make reset-embeddings`.

## Graph tools
- `get_backlinks(path, limit)` — notes that link TO `path` (resolved links only).
- `get_links(path)` — outgoing links from `path`, both resolved and dangling.
- `get_neighborhood(path, depth=1, limit=50)` — undirected BFS over the resolved-link graph; capped at `depth ≤ 5` and `limit ≤ 200`.
- `find_related(path, limit=10)` — semantic neighbors via averaged chunk embeddings; pgvector cosine distance, deduped per note.
- `find_orphans(folder, limit)` — notes with no incoming or outgoing resolved links; vault-hygiene tool.

Link extraction lives in `src/services/links.py`. The extractor strips fenced/inline code before regex matching for `[[wikilink]]`, `![[embed]]`, and `[md](path.md)` forms. Targets are resolved at index time and stored in `note_links`. On startup, if `note_links` is empty the indexer runs a one-shot backfill across all notes (logged with progress and surfaced on the dashboard).

## Write tools
- `create_note(path, content)` — create a new note (atomic write).
- `edit_note(path, content, append=False, find=None, section=None, replace_all=False, dry_run=False)` — four mutually exclusive modes (full-replace, append, find/replace, section). `dry_run` returns a unified diff without writing; `replace_all` lifts the single-match guard for `find`. Section mode matches ATX headings only and supports `Parent/Child` path-style disambiguation.
- `move_note(from_path, to_path, rewrite_links=False)` — rename or relocate a note. Updates `notes_metadata.file_path` and `note_links.target_path` rows for the moved note. With `rewrite_links=True`, also rewrites `[[Old]]` / `[[Old|alias]]` / `[[Old#anchor]]` / `![[Old]]` / `[[folder/Old]]` forms in source notes.
- `delete_note(path, permanent=False)` — soft-delete to `.trash/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>-<basename>` by default; `permanent=True` does a hard `os.unlink`. The indexer skips dot-dirs, so search/embedding cleanup happens on the next reindex pass.
- `set_frontmatter(path, updates, remove=[])` — structured YAML frontmatter mutation. Round-trips via `yaml.safe_dump` (does not preserve YAML comments). Leaves the body byte-identical.

All write tools route through `src/services/vault.py::write_file`, which writes to a tmp file in the same directory and `os.replace()`s it into place — a crash mid-write cannot truncate the destination.
